\section{Mappings}

\subsection{Solution 1}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item This mapping is onto, it is not one to one and the inverse
    image of any \( t \in T  \) under \( \sigma  \) is \( \{\sqrt{t}, - \sqrt{t} \}     \).

  \item Onto, one to one, the inverse image of any \( t \in T \) under
      \( \sigma  \) is \( \{\sqrt{t}\}     \).

  \item Not onto, not one to one and the inverse image of any \( t \) under \( \sigma  \) is \( \{\sqrt{t}\} \) if \( t  \) is a perfect square.
    Otherwise, it is the empty set.

  \item Not onto, one to one. The inverse image of any \( t \in  T \) under \( \sigma  \) is going to be \( \{\frac{1}{2}t\}   \) if \( t  \) is even.
    Otherwise, it is the empty set.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solution 2}

We define a mapping \( f \colon  S \times T \to T \times S \colon  \)

\[
  f \left(a,b  \right) = \left( b, a \right)
.\] 

Proving this is one to one is a trivial exercise.
